**Word Frequency Analyzer** is a web application that allows users to analyze the most frequent words from a webpage by providing a given URL. The application consists of a frontend built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, and a backend API built with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **Cheerio**. The backend fetches the webpage, processes the content, and calculates the most frequent words, which are then displayed in a table format on the frontend.

## 📍 Overview

The **Word Frequency Analyzer** is a web application that processes the text of a webpage for a given URL and calculates the most frequent words. The application has two main components:

1. **Frontend**: Built with ![HTML](https://img.shields.io/badge/-HTML-FF5733?logo=html5&logoColor=white), ![CSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/-CSS-2965F1?logo=css3&logoColor=white), and ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-JavaScript-F7DF1E?logo=javascript&logoColor=black), it allows users to input a URL, view the list of words, and their frequencies in a clean table format.
2. **Backend**: Built with ![Node.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Node.js-339933?logo=node.js&logoColor=white), ![Express.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Express.js-000000?logo=express&logoColor=white), and ![Cheerio](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Cheerio-FFB439?logo=cheerio&logoColor=black), it fetches the webpage content, extracts text, and processes the word frequency analysis. The backend also handles any necessary data validation and error handling.

## 👾 Features

- **URL-based Text Analysis**: Analyze the most frequent words from any webpage by providing its URL.
- **Top N Words**: Display the most frequent words and their occurrences.
- **Interactive Table**: Results are shown in a well-structured table with word and frequency columns.
- **Error Handling**: The application gracefully handles errors such as invalid URLs or issues fetching the webpage content.
- **Customizable Word Count**: Allow users to specify the number of top words to display.

---

## 🛠 Architecture

The application is structured using a **client-server architecture**:

- **Frontend**: 
  - Developed with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to allow users to input a URL and view the result in a table format.
  - Fetches data from the backend API to display the word frequency analysis.

- **Backend**:
  - Built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**, and uses the **Cheerio** library to scrape and parse HTML.
  - Provides an API endpoint that processes the URL and returns the top N most frequent words from the webpage.
  - Uses **CORS** middleware to handle cross-origin requests.

## 📌 Project Roadmap

- [X] **`Task 1`**: <strike>Implement backend API for calculating word frequencies from a webpage.</strike>
- [X] **`Task 2`**: <strike>Build frontend to input a URL and display word frequency results in a table.</strike>
- [ ] **`Task 3`**: Improve word frequency analysis algorithm to handle large web pages more efficiently.
- [ ] **`Task 4`**: Add an option to filter the top `n` frequent words by length, frequency, or alphabetical order.
- [ ] **`Task 5`**: Implement pagination for displaying long lists of frequent words.
- [ ] **`Task 6`**: Add user authentication to store and view past word frequency analyses.
- [ ] **`Task 7`**: Deploy the backend API to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS).
- [ ] **`Task 8`**: Make frontend design more responsive for mobile and tablet users.
